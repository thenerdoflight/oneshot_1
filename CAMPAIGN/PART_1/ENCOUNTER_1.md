## E1
`Insert Players here` has lived a long and fulfilling life on Earth. Long and fulfilling are subjective terms. However, their death was a tragic one,
especially when they were struck by a small Nissan<sup>1</sup> flatbed going 25 MPH.

The player expects their death, but low and behold, they are provided a 1 time ticket to be isekai'd (lit. in another world). Of course, they're
not going to go empty handed.
