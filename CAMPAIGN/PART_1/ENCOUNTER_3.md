### E3
Now that you get closer towards the `Insert Low Level creature`, it seems that it was all but that. In front of you begins to look like something that may tower over you. 

Do you approach the creature?

* Approach:
    * As you approach the creature, you begin to see that it is a `Insert Color` Dragon. 
* Flee:
    * As you flee the creature, the creature takes notice and flies after you. It blocks your path of retreat.

#### DM
* This is a dragon misinterpreted as the previous `Insert Low Level creature`
* Depending on character action after approaching dragon, it will do different things.
    * Approach:
        * All player initiatives are above the creature
        * All player  
    * Flee:
        * All player initiative are below the creature
        * Something something damage
* Players are not expected to defeat this creature. On low player health, do not target them. Once all players are relatively low, pull the best plot armor.
