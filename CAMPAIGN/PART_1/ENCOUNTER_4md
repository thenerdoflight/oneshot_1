* Plot Armor saves the players
* It does not matter how the Dragon was removed from battle
  * However, if it was vaporized or magically disappeared
    * Tie in how there is a glimmer

### E4
`Explain how dragon was killed or removed`

It's remnants glimmer in the sun creating a double rainbow.

Do you pursue the end of the double rainbow?

#### DM
* If players do not pursue the double rainbow, persuade them to walk somewhere
* That somewhere will have a bus sign
* Free rides to the town
