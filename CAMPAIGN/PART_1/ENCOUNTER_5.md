#### DM
* Depending on how the players reached town, use the proper dialog

### E5_A1_A (Rainbow)
As you walked towards the end of the rainbow, you see the gates of an unfamiliar town in the horizon.

You decide to approach ever so quickly, but there is already a line of `insert count` people outside the gates.

`Allow player actions here cuz we're gonna be here for a minute`

#### DM
* If the player does anything to harm the guards or cheat the town, they will be arrested. However, the bond for it is very low. Better yet, the party can not exit the town if not all members are together.
  * This can be circumvented :)
  
### E5_A1_B (Rainbow)
Now that you have reached the gates, the guard manning it asks:
"You got your documents?"

`If player asks about what documents?`
"Ah, you must be a traveler"
"Here's our day pass rates"

#### DM
* Use `~/MECHANICS/TOWN_ENTRANCE_TABLE.md`

### E5_A2_A (Free Ride)
You decided to catch a ride to the town. As you got closer, the gates of the town slowly towers you.

The vehicle stops and guards come on it. They reach their hands, and the passengers in front of you start handing out documents. 

A guard comes up to you and reaches their hand out.
`If player slaps their hand`
The guard chuckles and snaps their fingers for you to hurry up
`If player bribes`
`If player wtf`
The guard is disappointed and gets off the vehicle

#### DM
* Any actions here will result in forcing the player off the vehicle

You are being escorted out the vehicle.
Guard: 'Scum of the earth, trying to sneak into the town huh'

#### DM
