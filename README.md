# Welcome!

This is a guide for a very stupid oneshot adventure based on D&D 5E. It attempts to follow a majority of the works with a lot of major changes to accompany a oneshot.

This oneshot should be spread out into 4 sessions. It is just a nice little breather for your players if they have been on a long campaign. Theoretically, this can be done in one 8 hour session.
